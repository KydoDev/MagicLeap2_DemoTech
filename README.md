## no test on device


This project is focused on developing key features for the Magicleap2 device using the Mixed Reality Toolkit 3 (MRTK3). The Magicleap2 is an extended reality (XR) device that offers augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) capabilities to create immersive and interactive experiences.

Key Features:

  - Natural Interaction: The project focuses on creating natural interactions with the Magicleap2 using the features provided by MRTK3. This includes hand gestures, head movement tracking, voice input, and other innovative input modalities.

  - Spatial Sound: The project integrates spatial sound to create a realistic and engaging audio experience. This feature allows users to perceive audio from different directions based on their virtual position.

  - Object Recognition and Tracking: Using MRTK3, the project implements object recognition and tracking in the real world. This enables interaction with physical or virtual objects within the MR environment, paving the way for application scenarios such as displaying additional information about objects or interacting with virtual objects overlaid onto the real world.

  - UI and Spatial Layout: The project explores creating user interfaces (UI) and spatial layouts optimized for the Magicleap2. UI elements can be arranged coherently with the MR environment, ensuring good visibility and usability without compromising user immersion.

  - Input Handling: The project efficiently manages the various inputs of the Magicleap2, such as voice commands, hand gestures, and controller tracking. Intuitive solutions are implemented to interpret and respond to user inputs, enhancing the overall user experience.

The repository includes source code, d and practical examples to help developers understand and implement key features of the Magicleap2 device using MRTK3. The project welcomes collaboration and contributions from the XR developer community to improve and expand the offered functionalities.

Developing these features for the Magicleap2 using MRTK3 can unlock new possibilities in the field of XR experiences, enabling developers to create immersive and engaging applications for this device.
